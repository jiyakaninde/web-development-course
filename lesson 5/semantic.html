        <p> Here are some fun facts about dogs:
        Smell: Dogs have a sense of smell that's at least 40 times better than humans. Some dogs can even use their noses to
        detect medical problems.
        Sweating: Dogs have sweat glands in their paw pads, but they primarily cool down by panting.
        Nose prints: Dogs have unique nose prints, similar to human fingerprints, that can be used to identify them.
        Dreaming: Dogs dream like humans, and have similar sleep patterns and brain activity.
        Birth: Puppies are born blind and deaf, and rely on their sense of smell and heat receptors to find their mother.
        Color blindness: Dogs are red-green colorblind, but can see blues and yellows well.
        Third eyelid: Dogs have a third eyelid that protects their cornea by secreting tears.
        Basenjis: Basenjis are one of the only dog breeds that don't bark. Instead, they make a yodeling, whimpering, or howling
        sound.
        Swimming: Some dogs are excellent swimmers.
        Speed: Some dogs are fast enough to beat a cheetah.</p>
